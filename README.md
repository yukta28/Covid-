The spread of the global pandemic, COVID-19, has generated a huge and varied amount of data, which is increasing rapidly. This data can be used by applying data analytics techniques in multiple areas, including diagnosis, estimate or predict risk score, healthcare decision-making, and pharmaceutical industry.
It helps in understanding the nature of this virus in detail. The data obtained can further be trained over again for developing future preventive methods. This technology is used to store the data of all types of cases (infected, recovered and expired) affected by COVID-19.
This information can be effectively used for case identification and helping to allocate the resources for better protection of public health.
Several modalities of digital data including patient location, proximity, patient-reported travel, co-morbidity, patient physiology and current symptoms can be digitised and used for generating actionable insights at both community and demography levels.
